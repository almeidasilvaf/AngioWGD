> **1) How do I report an issue or suggest a feature?**
>
> You can open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/almeidasilvaf/AngioWGD) 
> where the source code for this app is.

> **2) How do I save figures/tables to files?**
>
> Boxes in all tabs with figures and tables have a download 
> button (![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/download.svg){width="1%"})
> at the top right corner. By clicking it, you can specify the output file 
> format (.pdf/.svg for figures, .tsv/.tsv.gz for tables), and download the file
> to your local machine.

> **3) In the posterior distributions of WGD ages, how do you obtain the 'consensus' distribution?**
>
> The 'consensus' distribution is obtained from data points from all species combined.
> For example, signatures of the *JUGL* WGD event (shared by all Juglandaceae 
> species) were identified in four species. When visualizing age distributions
> for this WGD, you will be able to see four different distributions (each with 20,000 
> data points) on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side, you will see
> a single distribution with all data points combined, regardless of the species
> from which they were obtained (in this case, 4 x 20k = 80,000 data points).
